This query returns the descending list of xact_seqno before the date set in the where condition, the major must be taken into account

```sql
SELECT top 100 * FROM MSrepl_transactions
WHERE publisher_database_id = 4 AND entry_time <= '2019-08-05'
ORDER BY entry_time DESC
```
**sp_MSdelete_publisherdb_trans** performs the cleanup without any check of all the commands and transactions queued in the distributor, prior to the passed xact_seqno.

Use the xact_seqno value returned by the previous query.

**ATTENTION: the command could cancel commands not yet delivered and break some subscriptions**
```sql
DECLARE @num_transactions INT, @num_commands INT

EXEC [dbo].[sp_MSdelete_publisherdb_trans]
    @publisher_database_id = 4,
    @max_xact_seqno = 0x004D467A0000C7920009,
	@max_cutoff_time ='2019-08-05',
    @num_transactions = @num_transactions,
    @num_commands = @num_commands
```

The following query is extracted from the stored procedure sp_MSmaximum_cleanup_seqno, returns the maximum xact_seqno which can be deleted without breaking any subscriptions.

The first xact_seqno returned is the one related to the subscription with the lowest xact_seqno.

The second xact_seqno returned if null indicates that the subscription identified by the previous xact_seqno is blocking the normal cleanup, otherwise if a value is returned it indicates that the cleanup is not blocked and it will delete all commands and transactions preceding the returned xact_seqno.
